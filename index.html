      <h3>  The school I go to:</h3>
    </div>
      <p>I go to the Waldorf School of Orange County, this is a private school and theres probably about 70 students in the whole high school..
      yeah it's pretty small. I'm an upcoming junior and I have 20 students in my class, I've known almost everyone for at least 10-13 years, some of them I've known for my whole life!
      My school focuses on creativity and art, my art teacher is Italian and he's very unorganized haha but he's an amazing artist.<p>

      <h3>  My hobbies:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>I grew up always loving art. Ever since I can remeber I've been drawing whenever I had the time.
        I would sketch and paint different drawings out of my imaginations when I was younger.</p>

    <p> My other hobby that I love is dancing. I've been dancing since I was 4, I started out with ballet but stopped because I hated it when
      I was very young. I started dancing again when I was 10, and I took jazz, tap, and ballet again, I stopped after a couple months passed.
      Then I started dancning again at the age of 13 or 14, I took dance once more and started taking hiphop. After a year I stopped.. again. Then
      at the begining of my sophmore year I took ballet again and stopped after a couple months.<p>
